# rock_papper_scissor2

This is my first Flutter project.

## Overview

The Rock Paper Scissors app is a simple and fun Flutter application that allows users to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer opponent. This app serves as a great example of using Flutter to build interactive mobile applications with basic game logic.

## Features

** Interactive Gameplay: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with a visually appealing interface.
** Randomized Computer Moves: The computer's moves are generated randomly to ensure fair play.
** Score Tracking: Keep track of the score to see how many games you have won, lost, or tied.
** Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
